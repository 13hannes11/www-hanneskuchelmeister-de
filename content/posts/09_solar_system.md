This project was created for an assignment in the course  3d-graphics at Linnaeus University. The visualization is written using  directly OpenGL APIs which are exposed by JOGL. The size of planets and  their orbits is not to scale but the rotation and speed of planets is.  All shaders are self written and the scene is lit using local  phong-lighting.
