The actual title of my thesis is "Decision Support for Group-Based Configuration using Recommender Systems". In it I looked at supporting a group during a configuration process with a recommender system. Basically during the configuration process the group can add their preferences and will get a recommendation based on the preferences of each member of the group.
The system can be seen in action in this video:

Unfortunatly I can only publish the code for my recommender system and not for the whole configurator but you can find it on [GitHub](https://github.com/13hannes11/bachelor_thesis_m.recommend).

Also you can find my the process of my writing and the documents of my thesis, proposals and other documents on [GitHub](https://github.com/13hannes11/bachelor_thesis).
