I decided to move this website away from wordpress to a static site generator. This has the advatage that I do not constantly need to update. Moreover, I don't have problems with security issues as there is no online login and the website's speed increases.
Also as the website is not updated often regenerating the site is more effective and allows more hosting options. The system I decided to use is [hugo](https://gohugo.io). I modified the theme [hugo coder](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder) and forked it. It is available [here](https://github.com/13hannes11/hugo-coder-timeline).

The result is a simple, elegant and fast website.
