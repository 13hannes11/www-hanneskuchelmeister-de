This autumn I took a course in human computer interaction. The task was to think of a project idea, interview participants to gather data for actual needs, draw prototypical sketches and lastly, create a prototype. My idea was to create a to-do application that focuses on scheduling to-dos as calendar events to enable week planning.


My prototype is available at:
[demo](https://demos.hanneskuchelmeister.de/html/HCI_schedule/index.html)

And the source code, which is hacky and was put together without much time can be found here: [GitHub]()

These are the sketches I created beforehand:
