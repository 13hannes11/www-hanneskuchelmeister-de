## What is Toolbx Tuner?

**Toolbx Tuner** is a graphical application designed specifically for **Fedora Silverblue** users who work with [Toolbx](https://containertoolbx.org/). Its mission? To enhance the overall experience of managing toolboxes by providing an intuitive interface and streamlined functionality.

## Key Features of Toolbx Tuner v0.1.0

1. **List Toolboxes**: Toolbx Tuner allows you to view all your existing toolboxes in one place. No more digging through command-line output or manual searches! 🧰

2. **Launch Terminals Inside Toolboxes**: With a single click, you can open a terminal session directly within any toolbox. Say goodbye to typing lengthy commands just to access your containers. 🚀

3. **Compatibility Check**: On startup the application ensures that all required software, including gnome terminal and Toolbx, is installed. This feature streamlines the user experience! 🔍🔧

While the current version (v0.1.0) is an MVP with basic features, there are plans for the future, so stay tuned!



## Installation

For now Toolbox Tuner is only available directly via [Github](https://github.com/13hannes11/toolbox-tuner/releases/tag/v0.1.0) but a Flatpak release is in the works.
