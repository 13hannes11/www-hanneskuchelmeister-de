Last semester in one of my courses as project we as a group crawled voting data from the German and the UK Parliament and analysed it with a self organizing feature map. The report is available [here](/files/posts/NCML-Project_Report.pdf) and the code for the Project can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/13hannes11/UU_NCML_Project). The datasets are also available on Kaggle ([German Parliament](https://www.kaggle.com/haku6695/bundestag-abstimmungsverhalten), [UK Parliament](https://www.kaggle.com/depa3283/uk-parliament-voting-behaviour)).
