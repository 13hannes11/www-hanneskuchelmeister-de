In a [Code Hub Event](https://www.facebook.com/events/2013113072293111/)  from Kodkollektivet I was holding a presentation about Complexity  Theory and Computability. The ambition was to give a sneak peak into  both of these topics. To give a sneak peak a proof for the  Halting-Problem was presented additionally NP-Completeness was discussed  and a simple proof for the problem Knapsack was shown.
